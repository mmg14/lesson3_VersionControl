            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control System is a system that keeps on file each version of a file or files to keep record of each change made. Version Control Systems allow for multiple users to make changes on the same file without overwriting the files, allowing for a collaboration and for each file to be stored for later use. The system keeps track of each change and who made the change as well. The tracking notes what the change was and when it was made with the ability to merge the changes. This system allows for a user to go back to the backup of previous versions of the same file without having to start over. Version Control System makes theses separate versions of the files by storing them in a common repository. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Distributed Version Control System is a type of Version Control System that creates the complete repository for each user allowing for multiple users to have access to every version made of the project. Each version is available to every client, so that if one of the server dies every server would be able to completely back up the server with all of the data. An example of Distributed Version Control System would be Git. These Version Control Systems allow for a network of clients to work easily on projects together by allowing every user full access to every version of the project. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Remote Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Remote Repository is a repository that allows for several users to collaborate on work by hosting the versions of a project on the internet or network. By using a remote repository opposed to a local repository you are able to share work among team members. Using a Distributed Version Control System you are able to manage these repositories and store several of the remote repositories. You can access data from each remote repository using a Version Control System, such as Git. The Version Control System allows for separate team members collaborating on a project to pull and push data from their local repository to the remote repository. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Local repository is the repository of the individual user that resides on their own server. The local repository stores the data of the changes that can be tracked by the Version Control System. If you were to use the Version Control System, Git, and there were multiple team members on a project, the versions of the individual’s project would be saved on the local repository and the versions of all team members would be available on the remote repository through the Distributed Version Control System. The local repository stores the versions of the project with the creation of files and directories. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a Distributed Version Control System that allows for users to work on projects of every size proficiently. Git functions by storing each of the versions of the project locally and allowing for each user if there are multiple people working on the project to work with a faster speed. It stores files differently than other Version Control Systems by storing each version separately like a series of the project each time there is a change from each user. Git allows for multiple users to access the project without allowing for the users to overwrite each other’s work. Without being able to overwrite the project, it prevents an unintentional overwrite of the files. </p>
